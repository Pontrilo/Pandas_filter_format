# Pandas_filter_format
This program was created to allow the reading, filtering and formatting of excel files.

This program is a test file for work with pandas and therefore won't be helpful in general public use. However you can easily adapt this to any file by placing your file into the function and then adapting the if and elif to filter the data in a different way. The formats can also be used to change your data differently to how they have been done here.

Assuming your data was in the same setup as mine you could simply enter the fields in the function and the rest of the code should take care of itself.
